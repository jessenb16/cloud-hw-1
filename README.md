  2. Lambda Functions (LF0, LF1, LF2)
  3. Other Scripts (Loading DDB and OS)

Here is the link to the video demonstration:

Please feel free to skip through minutes 5-7 where LF2 attempts to process the SQS information with an incorrect email before sending it to the DLQ and then finally processes the SQS information with the correct email.
